Your rapidograph pens are fucking dried up, the x-acto blades in your bag are rusty, and your mind is dull. Stop clicking your mouse, get messy, go back to the basics and make something fucking original. To surpass others is fucking tough, if you only do as you are told you don’t have it in you to succeed. Dedicate yourself to lifelong fucking learning. Learn from fucking criticism. Use your fucking hands. What’s important is the fucking drive to see a project through no matter what. Remember it’s called the creative process, it’s not the creative fucking moment. You are not your fucking work. Why are you fucking reading all of this? Get back to work. Never, never assume that what you have achieved is fucking good enough. Creativity is a fucking work-ethic. Don’t get hung up on things that don’t fucking work. Never let your guard down by thinking you’re fucking good enough. Form follows fucking function. The details are not the details. They make the fucking design. Must-do is a good fucking master. Can we all just agree as the greater design community to stop fucking talking about Comic Sans altogether? It’s getting fucking old. Don’t fucking lie
